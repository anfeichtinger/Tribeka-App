# testapi

## Running the Application Locally

Run `aqueduct serve` from this directory to run the application. For running within an IDE, run `bin/main.dart`. By default, a configuration file named `config.yaml` will be used.

Before the server can start, the user must provide credentials. Those credentials have to be put under `lib/testapi.dart`. There is a TODO comment under which email and password can be set.
